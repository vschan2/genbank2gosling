# GenBank Preprocessing Pipeline for Gosling.js Comparative Visualization

A preprocessing pipeline that converts raw GenBank records into the derived datasets needed to build linked, multi-view [Gosling.js](https://gosling.js.org/) visualizations for comparative genomics. For each genome it extracts three data layers — **sequence**, **annotations**, and **GC skew** — and prepares them in the format each visualization scale requires (inline JSON/CSV for small genomes, tiled multivec pyramids for large ones).

The design targets two independent comparison contexts ("clusters"). Genomes *within* a cluster are compared against each other in one linked multi-view chart; the two clusters themselves are entirely separate outputs — never combined into a single chart, like two separate figures, for instance:

| Cluster | Genome type | Typical size | Topology |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mitogenome cluster | Mitochondrial genomes (Lepidoptera) | ~15–20 kb | circular |
| Bacterial cluster | Complete bacterial chromosomes (*Corynebacterium*) | ~1–4 Mb | circular |

Draft/contig-level assemblies (multiple unordered scaffolds) are explicitly **out of scope** — each genome must be a single complete, contiguous record before entering the pipeline.

## Status

Design is finalized; implementation has not started. `scripts/stage1_parse.py` through `scripts/stage6_assemble.py` are empty stubs — see [Pipeline Stages](#pipeline-stages) below for the spec each one implements.

```

`input/` and `output/` are gitignored (source data is external; outputs are regenerated), so a fresh clone will have empty `input/mitogenomes/` and `input/bacteria/` directories — populate them with your own complete-genome `.gb` files before running the pipeline.

## Setup

The pipeline runs inside a WSL2 `dnavis-env` conda environment (not native Windows), because Stage 5's bacterial branch depends on `clodius`/`pysam`, which have no native Windows support. See `GenBank_Pipeline_Setup_Checklist.md` for the full Windows/WSL2 install walkthrough.

```bash
conda activate dnavis-env
```

Key packages: `biopython` (GenBank parsing), `pandas`/`numpy` (tabular + sliding-window math), `clodius` (multivec tiling, bacterial branch only — Linux/WSL2 only).

## Usage

Once implemented, each stage runs as a standalone script from the repo root:

```bash
conda activate dnavis-env
python scripts/stage1_parse.py
python scripts/stage2_sequence.py
python scripts/stage3_annotations.py
python scripts/stage4_gc_skew.py
python scripts/stage5_sequence_track.py
python scripts/stage6_assemble.py
```

Stage 5's bacterial (`clodius`) branch must run in WSL2/Linux.

## Pipeline Stages

### Stage 1 — Parse GenBank record(s)
- Tool: Biopython `SeqIO.parse(..., "genbank")`
- For each record, capture: accession, organism, molecule length, topology (`circular`/`linear`, from the `LOCUS` line), and the full nucleotide sequence.
- Records failing the "single complete contig" requirement are flagged and excluded from downstream steps.

### Stage 2 — Extract sequence (basepair) data
- Output: FASTA file per genome + a small metadata record (`length`, `topology`, `accession`).
- This sequence is the source for two downstream products:
  - The per-base **sequence track** (Stage 5)
  - The **GC skew** calculation (Stage 4)

### Stage 3 — Extract annotations
- Walk `record.features`, keep gene-level and functional features (`gene`, `CDS`, `tRNA`, `rRNA`, `D-loop`, `misc_feature`, `ncRNA`, `tmRNA`, `regulatory`, etc. depending on what the GenBank record contains).
- Fields captured per feature: `start`, `end`, `strand`, `type`, `name` (from `gene`/`product`/`locus_tag` qualifiers, in that preference order).
- Output: BED/CSV, one row per feature, one file per genome.

### Stage 4 — Compute GC skew
- Formula: `GC skew = (G − C) / (G + C)` over a sliding window; cumulative GC skew is also computed (useful for identifying origin/terminus regions in bacterial chromosomes).
- **Window and step size are auto-scaled to genome length** rather than fixed, since mitogenomes (~15 kb) and bacterial chromosomes (~1–4 Mb) differ by ~2 orders of magnitude:
  - `window ≈ length / 1000`
  - `step ≈ window / 5`
- Output: BedGraph/CSV (`chrom, start, end, gc_skew, cumulative_gc_skew`).

### Stage 5 — Prepare per-base sequence track data
The method depends on genome size, since Gosling loads inline data client-side without automatic tiling:

| Genome scale | Method | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Small (mitogenomes, tens of kb) | Inline JSON/CSV, one row per base; letters rendered via a `text` mark gated by a zoom-level `visibility` rule | Small enough to load entirely in-browser; no tiling infrastructure needed |
| Large (bacterial chromosomes, Mb-scale) | Multivec tile pyramid, generated offline via `clodius` (HiGlass's tiling CLI), served as static tiles | A flat per-base table (millions of rows) is too large to load/parse as one inline block; tiling lets the viewer fetch only the visible window at the current zoom level |

Multivec construction (bacterial genomes only):
1. One-hot encode the sequence into four rows (A/T/G/C).
2. Aggregate into a multi-resolution pyramid with `clodius` (same tiling concept used for BigWig tracks).
3. Export as a static tile directory (no persistent tile server required — just static file hosting).

### Stage 6 — Cluster assembly
- Each genome's outputs (FASTA/length, annotation BED/CSV, GC skew BedGraph/CSV, + sequence track data) are grouped per cluster into `output/mitogenome_cluster/` or `output/bacterial_cluster/`.
- Clusters are never mixed in a single chart.

## Gosling.js View Design (downstream of this pipeline)

- Each cluster is rendered as its own **multi-view stack**: one row-group per genome, each row-group containing an annotation track, a GC skew track, and a semantic-zoom-gated sequence track. This produces one independent chart per cluster (e.g. one chart for the Lepidoptera mitogenomes, a separate chart for the *Corynebacterium* genomes) — the two are never combined into a single view.
- All row-groups *within* a cluster's chart share a single `linkingId` on their `x` channel, so pan/zoom is **fully synchronized**: same absolute base-pair start position and same window width across every genome in that cluster simultaneously. If a window extends past a shorter genome's end, that track simply shows empty space beyond its boundary.
- Homology/synteny-linked comparison (connecting orthologous regions across genomes with ribbons/arcs) is a planned future extension and is **not** part of the current pipeline. It will require an additional alignment/ortholog-mapping step (e.g. MUMmer/nucmer, or shared locus-tag matching) not yet implemented.
